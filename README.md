# Ethereum 2.0 Custody Proof Storage System Using Smart Contracts (Blockchain Implementation)

This project is an implementation of a custody proof storage system using Ethereum 2.0 smart contracts, with a specific focus on the blockchain component.

## Overview
- The package structure is inspired by project structures commonly used in Google projects.
- Implemented the blockchain-related components of the project using `Solidity` and `abigen` for smart contract development.

## Package Structure
- `cmd` : Contains applications that can be executed, including connection tests and smart contract deployment tools.
- `internal` : Contains packages that are not accessible externally.
- `pkg` : Contains packages accessible by external references.
- `solidity` : Contains packages with Solidity files.
- `script` : Contains a collection of shell scripts.
